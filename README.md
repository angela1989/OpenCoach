# OpenCoach
Hello,
this is OpenCoach!

I wanna build a digital platform to monitor basketball teams. 
OpenCoach is a instrument to analyze players performances using video frames.   
The system is very simple: adopting smartphone cameras as webcam, it’s possible to get Personal Informations about players and ball in the basketball court during daily training.
They are processed in OpenCV libraries for Processing.

The first step is about the recognition of players and team.
It’s possible to go further: tracking them frame by frame and establish the right geographic location.

In this page there are several Processing codes that i used in my test. 
Everything is based on open libraries.

-  NyAR4psg (NyAR2) _ Computer Vision for Processing
   Reference: http://cpbotha.net/2010/06/05/processing-nyartoolkit-multiple-marker-tracking/
- OpenCv_ for Processing
- IP Capture_ library for smarphone webcam
- Color Detection_ code for color recognition
- GSVideo _ video Processing
- XQuartz _ .dmg for Mac
- ArToolKit mt_patt.exec _ to create personal marker in “patt.namepattern”

Check it out!  

[I’m an italian student in Interaction Design. I’ve never learn programming languages, just exercised in generative graphics. 
This is the concept idea of my thesis. The design project is about the interactive interfaces of this platform. Thank you!]
